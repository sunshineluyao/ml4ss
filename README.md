[Open the revised Week 1 Wednesday notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sunshineluyao/ml4ss/blob/main/modules/00-foundations/02_week1_research_innovation.ipynb)

Wednesday Research addresses Monday's feedback on originality, empirical design and data access before the Innovation canvas. It adds a seven-resource publication-linked data catalog, three small real-data excerpts and a research-design form. See [the Foundations guide](modules/00-foundations/README.md) for the distinction between observed data, published summaries and synthetic tutorials, access conditions, provenance and the short visual reflection.


[Open the Week 1 Day 1 notebook in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sunshineluyao/ml4ss/blob/main/modules/00-foundations/01_questions_evidence_methods.ipynb)

1. Save a notebook copy in Drive.
2. Read the opening purpose and learning-objective map; work individually or in a group of 1–3.
3. Complete the student-input forms in Parts 1–3. In Part 3, run each filled teaching example, read its printed output, replace the example with your own checked work, and rerun the inline review. No ZIP or file download is required.

## The Day 1 investigation

The notebook has exactly three top-level parts, with numbered subsections:

| Part | Student activity | What changes |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Learn and experiment with research methods | Read the concepts; record an initial question and expectation; change proxy noise, budget share, or seed. | A shared 600-person simulation and its numerical results. |
| 2. Discover and verify literature on your question | Change the topic, comparison topic, year range, retrieval cap, or source mode; inspect and verify records. | Bibliographic discovery and literature charts. |
| 3. Explain, reflect, and display your investigation | Replace filled examples with your finding, revision, next step, innovation canvas, manual audit, and two original-source checks. | Your responses print below each cell and appear together in the final inline review. |

Every section identifies **READ & LEARN**, **STUDENT INPUT**, **RUN & OBSERVE**, or **HUMAN CHECK**. All 26 form fields have definitions, defaults, allowed values, examples, and expected effects. The package guide explains NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, IPython, the standard-library tools, and alternatives linked to official documentation.

`TOPIC` changes literature discovery. `PURPOSE` and `CONTEXT` record the student's intended purpose and setting; they do not select a model or apply a geographic filter. All numerical methods use the common simulated case. For a controlled experiment, change one parameter and keep the seed fixed.

After changing an analysis setting, run all cells. After changing only Part 3 text, run each edited input cell and the final inline review. The review detects stale analysis settings. Example text and source/search statuses are clearly labeled; students must replace the examples and perform their own checks. If saving or downloading is unavailable, copy displayed responses and required figures into the course-approved submission channel before closing the session. When saving is available, retain an instructor-accessible Colab copy with outputs.

The tutorial includes motivation, philosophical and mathematical definitions, pseudocode, executable CPU examples, real literature metadata, visualization outputs, guiding questions, and a recorded investigation. Its numerical data are explicitly synthetic. Automated literature method labels require human verification. Database-wide trend counts are distinguished from the distribution of a retrieved sample. Frontier papers are inspected; their large models are not executed in this Day 1 tutorial.

## Modules

| Folder | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `modules/00-foundations/` | Questions, evidence, and methods. Day 1 notebook available. |
| `modules/01-measurement/` | Future measurement tutorials. |
| `modules/02-explanation/` | Future explanation tutorials. |
| `modules/03-prediction/` | Future prediction tutorials. |
| `modules/04-causal-inference/` | Future causal inference tutorials. |
| `modules/05-optimization/` | Future decision and optimization tutorials. |
| `modules/06-frontier-methods/` | Future evaluation of emerging methods. |

`collaborative-learning/` reserves notebook locations for think-pair-share, workshops, symposia, exhibitions, peer review, reflection activities, and certificates. These directories are structural placeholders, not claims that those tutorials are released.

## Repository scope

This repository contains interactive code notebooks and supporting repository structure. Course slides, agendas, release packages, student submissions, reflections, grades, and identifiable education-study records belong in the course's approved communication and storage channels.

## Reuse and sources

Original executable code is MIT licensed. Original instructional prose and original conceptual visualizations in the notebooks are available under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). OpenAlex bibliographic metadata are CC0; linked publications and any third-party materials retain their own licenses. The notebook records source URLs and retrieval times. Cite individual scholarly sources as well as this teaching resource when appropriate.

## Environment and verification

The core uses Python, NumPy, pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, and IPython, all normally present in Colab. `requirements.txt` provides compatible local installation ranges. No hosted generative-AI account or GPU is required. Network retrieval is optional because the notebook embeds a dated metadata sample. A zero-match fallback remains visible and does not fabricate sources.

The revised Wednesday notebook contains 25 executable cells. The October 28 revision was executed locally in real in-process IPython with zero cell errors and saved rich/text outputs. Focused checks cover filled Part 3 defaults, immediate printed responses, the complete inline review, edited answer/canvas/audit/source refresh including Unicode, cleared-field status, all four stale-analysis guards, and absence of ZIP creation. Execution inside a signed-in hosted Google Colab runtime was not performed.


Current Week 1 reading policy: Active research literature uses the rolling window October 27 2024 to October 27 2026, in leading journals or main conference proceedings. Older classics are retained only with a verified Nobel or Turing author exception. Dataset observations, provider instructions, course policies and original-paper bibliographies are source records rather than new reading recommendations. The classroom A2 worksheet records a prediction before Colab and an observed result and revised design after it. The individual reflection is a separate PDF of at most two A4 pages, named netID_LastName_Firstname.pdf, attached to a reply on the Ed reflection post.
